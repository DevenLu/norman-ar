NormanAR
======

This is a complementary app to [James Paterson's](https://github.com/presstube) [NormanVR](https://normanvr.com/) [project](https://github.com/presstube/norman) that displays norman animations in augmented reality using [ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar/) and [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/).

Two versions of the app are included in this repo and they both do exactly the same thing: draw norman animations and place them in space. The difference is that the `normanARShader` version shows how you can work with shaders and ARCore. 

Please note this app currently only works with Android phones that support [ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/). 

## Usage Details

For now, there are three "invisible" buttons you can tap. The bottom third of the screen contains a *next* and *previous* button to cycle through animations. The rest of the screen is for the *placing* button, which anchors an animation to a specific place in space.

## Setup
1. **Prepare your device for use with ARCore**: first you need to install the ARCore service on your device. The best way to do so is to follow [these](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/downloads) instructions.  

2. **Download an experimental version of openFrameworks**: To use ARCore we currently have to use a special version of openFrameworks (OF). This will change in the near future, but for now snatch [this](https://github.com/halfdanj/openframeworks/tree/android-camera-permissions) version of OF. 

3. **Download openFrameworks libraries**: You'll also need to download a few additional libraries for OF. Simply run the `download_libs.sh` script found in `openFrameworks/scripts/android/`. 

4. **Get ofxARCore**: Download the openFrameworks ARCore [addon](https://github.com/HalfdanJ/ofxARCore). Unzip the folder and move it to the addons folder so your path looks like so: `openFrameworks/addons/ofxARCore/`.

5. **Download NormanAR**: Download this repo, unzip it and place it within the apps folder in openFrameworks. The path to the norman app should be: `openFrameworks/apps/normanAR/`.

6. **Download Android Studio**: The app has been tested with [Android Studio 2](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html). 

7. **Open NormanAR with Android Studio**: Use the "Open an existing Android Studio project" option and open either the `normanAR/normanAR` project or the `normanAR/normanARShader` project. Once that's launched, you'll have to set the project path to Android NDK r12b. Download the NDK [here](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r12b-darwin-x86_64.zip). Then set the new NDK path in your "Project Structure" settings. If you're confused about how to do that, read the "Compile the app on Android Studio" section in this [getting started](https://medium.com/energeia/getting-started-with-openframeworks-on-android-5202b92f6582) guide.

8. **Build the project and deploy to your phone:** Have fun

By default, Android Studio will deploy a debug version of the app to your phone. The release version will run much faster, but to deploy that you'll have to build a [signed APK](https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud853/course_resources/creating-a-signed-apk) for your phone. 

If you're generally new to openFrameworks and confused about installation, [this getting started guide](https://medium.com/energeia/getting-started-with-openframeworks-on-android-5202b92f6582) has some general pointers even though it uses a more stable branch of OF. 


## Creating custom animations

Each version of the app comes with four animations (each in the form of a json file) stored within the `bin/data/animations` folder. More animations can be found in the `animations/` folder. The more json files you load, the longer it will take for your app to open. 

More details for creating your own custom animations to come soon.

## Troubleshooting
* For general openFrameworks and Android Studio problems checkout this [getting started](https://medium.com/energeia/getting-started-with-openframeworks-on-android-5202b92f6582) guide. 
* After installing the APK on your phone, make sure the camera permissions for the app are set appropriately. Go to `Settings > App info > normanAR > Permissions` and make sure the camera permissions is turned on.
